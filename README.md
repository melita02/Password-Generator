Password Generator is a simple application which can randomly generate passwords with the combination of letters, numbers and special characters based on a length given by the user. 
The user can enter his username and can generate the password by specifying the length which is then stored with their username in a database.
The program only accepts users whose usernames are not previously stored.
It uses Python Tkinter for the GUI and Python SQLite3 for the database.
